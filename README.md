# My-Django-Project

My name is daxton (it really is!) and this is my website called 'Discourse'
Discourse is a fun website that has a few quirky features:
- you can register and log in as a user
- as a user, you can like groups create groups and post (and of course delete said posts)
- as an anon, you can browse through posts but cannot inter
- liked groups appear under favorites where you can easily find posts to return to later
- to find different sorts of groups, you can sort by likes (popular), hot (up-in-coming) and recent (time-wise)

Discourse has a really intuitive interface and if you love it just half as much as I do, you won't be able to tear your eyes away
No, like seriously, there should be like a hazard or something: like, BEST WEBSITE EVER sort of thing
ya know?

I am of course jking, but have a fantastic summer.

Sincerely,
Dax
